description: Step-by-step guide to setting up telemetry in your Shuttle project
---

This guide will walk you through setting up telemetry for your Shuttle project. We'll cover the basic setup that applies to all telemetry providers, and then point you to provider-specific guides.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:
1. A Shuttle project deployed
2. Access to the Shuttle Console
3. An account with your chosen telemetry provider (e.g., Better Stack)

## Step 1: Enable the OpenTelemetry Exporter

First, you need to enable telemetry export in your project. Add the `setup-otel-exporter` feature to your `shuttle-runtime` dependency:

```bash
cargo add shuttle-runtime -F setup-otel-exporter
```

Your `Cargo.toml` should include:

```toml
shuttle-runtime = { version = "0.53.0", features = ["setup-otel-exporter"] }
```

## Step 2: Choose Your Telemetry Provider

Shuttle supports several telemetry providers. Each has its own setup process:

- [Better Stack](./betterstack) - Recommended for most users
- More providers coming soon!

## Step 3: Configure Your Provider

Follow the specific guide for your chosen provider to:
1. Create a telemetry source in your provider's dashboard
2. Get your provider's connection details (usually an API key and endpoint)
3. Configure these details in the Shuttle Console

## Step 4: Redeploy Your Project

<Warning>
    **Important**: After configuring telemetry, you must redeploy your project for the changes to take effect.
    You can do this by selecting your latest deployment in the Shuttle Console and clicking "Redeploy".
</Warning>

## Next Steps

Once your telemetry is set up, you can:
- [Add custom metrics](./overview#guide-add-custom-metrics-in-tracing-events) to your application
- Create dashboards in your provider's interface
- Monitor your application's performance and health
