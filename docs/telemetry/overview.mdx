{/* TODO: Showcase with GIF or images showing off cool things you can build with this */}

Under the hood, Shuttle runs an OpenTelemetry (OTel) collector alongside your service that, once configured, sends project telemetry like vCPU and RAM usage as well as any custom metrics you define to a supported third-party integration of your choice.

## Quick Start

To get started with telemetry in your Shuttle project, follow our [step-by-step guide](./getting-started).

## Available Telemetry

### Community Tier - Container Metrics

The Community tier provides essential container metrics to help you monitor your application's resource usage. You'll have access to key metrics across CPU, memory, network, and storage performance.

For detailed information about specific metrics, see the [Default Platform Metrics](#default-platform-metrics) section below.

### Pro & Growth Tiers - Everything

Upgrade to Pro or Growth tier to unlock:

1. **All Container Metrics** - Everything from the Community tier
2. **Application Metrics** - Track your application's behavior with [custom metrics](./custom-metrics)
3. **Application Logs** - Export tracing events and logs (not stdout/stderr)
4. **No Export Limits** - Send as much data as you need

## Supported Providers

Currently, Shuttle supports the following telemetry providers:

- [Better Stack](./betterstack) - Recommended for most users
- More providers coming soon!

<Note>
    We plan to expand the list of supported third party services.

## Custom Metrics and Tracing

Learn how to add custom metrics and tracing events to your application in our [Custom Metrics Guide](./custom-metrics).

## Default Platform Metrics

The following table lists all container metrics that Shuttle automatically collects and exports via OpenTelemetry for every deployment.
