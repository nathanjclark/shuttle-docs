<Note>
This guide assumes you have installed the Shuttle CLI. If you haven't, please visit the [installation guide](./installation) first.
</Note>

## Getting Started

This guide will walk you through:
1. Logging into your Shuttle account
2. Creating your first project
3. Running it locally
4. Deploying it to the cloud

## Login to Your Account

First, you'll need to authenticate with Shuttle. The login command will open your browser to the [Shuttle Console](https://console.shuttle.dev/) where you can authenticate:

```sh
shuttle login
```

<Info>You can use your Google account, GitHub account or email to authenticate with Shuttle.</Info>

## Create Your First Project

The `init` command helps you create a new Shuttle project. You can choose from:
- A simple Hello World template
- One of our [example projects](/examples)
- A [pre-built template](/templates)

For your first project, we recommend starting with the Hello World template:

```sh
shuttle init
```

The CLI will guide you through:
1. Choosing a project name
2. Selecting a template
3. Setting up your project structure

<Info>Your project name will be used as part of the deployment URL. Choose something unique and descriptive.</Info>

## Project Structure

After initialization, you'll have a new directory with the following structure:

```
your-project/
â”œâ”€â”€ Cargo.toml
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ main.rs
â””â”€â”€ Shuttle.toml
```

- `Cargo.toml`: Your Rust project's manifest file
- `src/main.rs`: Your application code
- `Shuttle.toml`: Shuttle-specific configuration

## Run Your Project Locally

Before deploying, you can run your project locally to test it:

```sh
shuttle run
```

This will:
1. Start a local development server
2. Build your project
3. Make it available at `http://localhost:8000`

<Note>Local development includes hot-reloading, so changes to your code will automatically update the running application.</Note>

## Deploy Your Project

When you're ready to deploy your project to the cloud:

```sh
shuttle deploy
```

This will:
1. Package your code
2. Upload it to Shuttle's platform
3. Build it into a Docker image
4. Deploy it to our infrastructure in AWS (eu-west-2)
5. Provide you with a public HTTPS URL

<Info>The first deployment might take a few minutes as it builds your project and sets up the infrastructure.</Info>

## Next Steps

Now that you've deployed your first project, you might want to:

- Add a [database](/resources/shuttle-shared-db) to your project
- Set up [environment variables](/resources/shuttle-secrets)
- Explore more [examples](/examples)
- Check out our [templates](/templates)
