## Prerequisites

Before installing Shuttle, make sure you have:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed (version 1.70 or later)

## Installation Methods

The Shuttle CLI can be installed in several ways and you can choose the method that best suits your needs.

### Install Script (Recommended)

The install script automatically detects your system and installs the appropriate version. It's the easiest way to get started.

#### Linux and macOS

```sh
curl -sSfL https://www.shuttle.dev/install | bash
```

#### Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
iwr https://www.shuttle.dev/install-win | iex
```

<Info>The install script will automatically detect your system architecture and install the appropriate binary. It also adds the Shuttle CLI to your PATH.</Info>

### Alternative Installation Methods

#### Using cargo-binstall

If you prefer using Cargo's package manager, you can use [cargo-binstall](https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall):

```sh
cargo binstall cargo-shuttle
```

#### From Source

For those who prefer building from source:

```sh
cargo install cargo-shuttle
```

<Note>Building from source requires a Rust toolchain and may take longer than other installation methods.</Note>

#### Pre-built Binaries

Pre-built binaries for various platforms are available on [our GitHub releases page](https://github.com/shuttle-hq/shuttle/releases/latest).

### Community Packages
