The install script collects anonymous telemetry data to help improve the product. You can opt out by setting any of these environment variables to `1` or `true`:

- `DO_NOT_TRACK`
- `DISABLE_TELEMETRY`
- `SHUTTLE_DISABLE_TELEMETRY`

Telemetry is also automatically disabled in CI environments when the `CI` environment variable is set to `true`.
