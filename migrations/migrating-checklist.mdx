## Service Compatibility

Before starting your migration, check if your project meets these requirements:

### ✅ Supported Service Types
- HTTP web services using:
  - [Axum](/migrations/frameworks/axum)
  - [Actix Web](/migrations/frameworks/actix-web)
  - [Rocket](/migrations/frameworks/rocket)
  - Other HTTP frameworks (via [custom service](/migrations/frameworks/custom-service))
- Discord bots
- Telegram bots
- Web services connecting to RPC nodes
- Services with scheduled tasks (cronjobs)

### ✅ Runtime Requirements
- Your service must be able to:
  - Bind to a network socket
  - Handle HTTP traffic (for web services)
  - Run as a long-lived process
  - Be packaged as a Rust binary

### ⚠️ Potential Limitations
- Services that require:
  - Multiple network ports
  - Custom system-level configurations
  - Specific hardware requirements
  - Root/system-level access

## Resource Compatibility

### ✅ Supported Resources
- [Postgres databases](/migrations/resources/postgres)
- [Secrets and environment variables](/migrations/resources/secrets)
- External services (with your credentials):
  - [Turso](/integrations/shuttle-turso)
  - [Qdrant](/integrations/shuttle-qdrant)
  - [Apache OpenDAL](/integrations/shuttle-opendal)
  - [OpenAI](/integrations/shuttle-openai)

### ⚠️ Resource Considerations
- Database migrations need to be handled separately
- Secrets must be migrated to `Secrets.toml`
- External service credentials need to be provided
- Resource provisioning happens at runtime

## Migration Readiness

### ✅ Project Structure
- Your project should:
  - Use Cargo for dependency management
  - Have a clear entry point (main.rs)
  - Follow Rust best practices
  - Have tests that can be run locally

### ✅ Dependencies
- Check that your dependencies:
  - Are compatible with the latest Rust version
  - Don't require system-level libraries
  - Can be built in a containerized environment

## Next Steps

If your project meets these requirements:

1. [Start the migration process](/migrations/migration-guide)
2. [Choose your framework guide](/migrations/frameworks)
3. [Migrate your resources](/migrations/resources)
